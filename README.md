## üìñ Overview

Runway Reactions is a comprehensive, interactive web application designed to analyze customer sentiment and discover insights from fashion product reviews. This project transforms over 20,000 raw text reviews into a user-friendly dashboard that reveals not only *if* customers are happy, but *why*. It showcases an end-to-end data science workflow, from data cleaning and analysis to machine learning and final deployment.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Interactive Dashboard:** A multi-page Streamlit application with a custom, aesthetic user interface for a professional feel.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizes a pre-trained `transformers` model (DistilBERT) from Hugging Face to perform sentiment analysis on every customer review, classifying them as POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Interactive charts and metrics that allow users to filter data by department and instantly see breakdowns of ratings and sentiment.
* **Topic Modeling:** Employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with `scikit-learn` to automatically discover the key themes and reasons for complaints within negative reviews.
* **Content-Based Recommendation Engine:** A feature that suggests similar products to the user based on the textual content of reviews, calculated using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
